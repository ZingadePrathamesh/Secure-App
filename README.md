# üîê Secure App

Secure App is a robust, production-grade **Spring Boot REST API** built to demonstrate strong backend security practices using modern techniques and libraries. This project showcases your proficiency in securing APIs with features like **JWT Authentication**, **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**, **Account Activation via Email**, **Argon2d password encryption**, and **protection against brute force attacks and DoS attacks**.

|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Spring Security**                         | Industry-standard authentication & authorization configuration                                          |
| **JWT Authentication (HS256)**              | Stateless and secure authentication via JSON Web Tokens                                                 |
| **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)**        | Admin/user role segregation and endpoint protection                                                     |
| **Account Activation**                      | Email verification workflow before login is enabled                                                     |
| **Argon2d Password Hashing**                | Advanced password encryption algorithm for strong password security                                     |
| **Brute Force Attack Prevention**           | Protects login endpoints by tracking failed attempts and locking accounts after repeated failures        |
| **DoS Protection via Rate Limiting**        | Uses in-memory bucket (Bucket4j) to limit request rates per IP, mitigating denial-of-service attacks    |

## üõ° Security Highlights

‚úÖ **Argon2d encryption** ensures user passwords are securely hashed with resistance to GPU cracking.

‚úÖ **JWT tokens** allow for scalable, stateless authentication across your backend.

‚úÖ **Role-based access control (RBAC)** lets you easily control which endpoints are accessible to which user roles.

‚úÖ **Account lockout mechanism** tracks failed login attempts and temporarily locks accounts after too many failures, defending against brute force login attempts.

‚úÖ **In-memory rate limiting** using Bucket4j applies DoS protection by throttling the number of requests allowed per client IP.
